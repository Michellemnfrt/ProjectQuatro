### Welcome to my Warranty Service Tracker!

I created this project using bootstrap, Django, Django authentication, PostgreSQL. The purpose of this app is to track repairs completed on a vehicle to assess a mechanic's productivity, weaknesses and evaluate the frequency of service. User are able to create accounts input repairs and search through repairs, by vehicle type, car model, and car ID. The app was styled using Bootstrap influenced by the tunr.django app.
